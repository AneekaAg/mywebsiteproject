title: Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance
---

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. We worked with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE, results='hide', include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)
library(infer)
library(openintro)
library(psych)
```


```{r}

data(yrbss)

```


```{r, eda_on_weight}

ggplot(yrbss,aes(x= weight)) + geom_histogram()
```
```{r, boxplot}
yrbss_3d <- yrbss %>% mutate(physical_3plus =  ifelse(physically_active_7d>= 3/7, 'yes', 'no'))
yrbss_3d <- na.omit(yrbss_3d)
ggplot(yrbss_3d, aes(x = physical_3plus, y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

```
From the boxplot we see that The proportion of students who do physical exercise less than 3 days a week seem to have higher median weight as compared the ones who don't.
