Hello, my name is **Aneeka Agarwal** and I am 21 years old. 
I was born and brought up in the busiest city of India, Mumbai (formerly
known as Bombay). Until now, that has been the only place I've called
home (Adding london to the list now). I did my schooling from Vibgyor
High International School. I took up Commerce as my major for 11th and
12th standard and did my undergraduate studies in Applied Statistics and
Analytics at NMIMS Mumbai. I am currently
enrolled in the Masters in Analytics and Management Programme at London
Business School.

Some of my favourite activities include:

\- Painting (The above image is a canvas paining I made with my mom)

\- Dancing 

\- Handball 

\- Playing the violin 

I have worked for a year as an Analyst at Deloitte USI. The work I did
there made me more interested in data analytics which is why I chose to
further explore the subject at LBS. I aspire to be working as a Business
Analyst in some of the big tech firms. Here is a link to my
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneeka-agarwal/) profile to know
more about my journey.
